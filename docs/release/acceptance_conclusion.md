# Acceptance Conclusion (v1.0 Closure)

## Result
- Forced documentation closure executed in repository path.
- Required release docs created under `docs/release/`.

## Completed
- [x] `docs/release/release_notes.md`
- [x] `docs/release/risk_rollback.md`
- [x] `docs/release/acceptance_conclusion.md`
- [ ] `docs/release/docs_update_proof.md` (generated after commit hash is available)

## Remaining Risk
- Orchestrator routing still occasionally assigns critical path outputs to non-deterministic agent roles.
- Should be fixed in orchestration template/prompt constraints.
